2. How to embed audio and video in a webpage? 
Ans.To embed audio and video in HTML, we use the <audio> tag,<video> tag. Before HTML5, audio cannot be added to web pages in the Internet Explorer era. To play audio, we used web plugins like Flash. After the release of HTML5, it is possible.

3. Semantic element in HTML5? 
Ans.A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

4.Canvas and SVG tags 
Ans.SVG: The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based image format that is used to define two-dimensional vector-based graphics for the web. Unlike raster image (Ex .jpg, .gif, .png, etc.), a vector image can be scaled up or down to any extent without losing the image quality.

Canvas: The HTML element is used to draw graphics on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript). The element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.
